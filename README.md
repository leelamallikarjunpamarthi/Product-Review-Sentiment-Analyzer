# Product-Review-Sentiment-Analyzer
Product Review Sentiment Analyzer
This project is a machine learning model that performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of product reviews. The goal is to classify reviews as either positive, negative, or neutral based on the text content.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Loads and samples a CSV dataset.

Vectorization: Converts text reviews into numerical feature vectors using CountVectorizer.

Model Training: Trains two classification models:

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Random Forest Classifier

Model Evaluation: Calculates and prints the accuracy score and a detailed classification report for each model.

Data Visualization: Generates a word cloud to visualize the most frequent words in the reviews.

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation, including CountVectorizer, MultinomialNB, RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split, and accuracy_score.

Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizations.

WordCloud: For generating word cloud visualizations.
